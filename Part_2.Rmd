### Overview
The purpose of the this data analysis is to analyze the ToothGrowth data set by
comparing the guinea tooth growth by supplement and dose. First, I will do
exploratory data analysis on the data set. Then I will do the comparison with
confidence intervals in order to make conclusions about the tooth growth.

### Load the ToothGrowth data and perform exploratory data analyses
```{r}
library(datasets)
data(ToothGrowth)
str(ToothGrowth)
head(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
```
